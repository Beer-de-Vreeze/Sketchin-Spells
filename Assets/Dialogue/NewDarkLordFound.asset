  - 'You step into the shadowed chamber, and an overwhelming sense of dread washes
    over you.


'
  - At the far end of the room, a towering figure emerges from the darkness, shrouded
    in an aura of pure malice.
  - "It\u2019s him\u2014the Dark Lord. But his form seems... incomplete, a swirling
    void where his true visage should be."
  - 'He speaks, his voice echoing like thunder: ''You dare to stand before me, yet
    you cannot even see my true face?'''
  - '"Use your sketch magic to reveal his form, brave hero. Draw the Dark Lord as
    you imagine him!"'
  - 'Be warned: the shape you give him may define the battle to come. Choose wisely.'
