  - "At last, you stand before the Dark Lord\u2014his presence chills the very air."
  - He is no mere foe, but a force of chaos itself... a being born from the void.
  - His form twists and fluctuates, impossible to grasp... but you know what must
    be done.
  - Use your sketch magic, hero. Draw the Dark Lord, give shape to his nightmarish
    essence.
  - Once you've drawn him, ready yourself. The battle of fate begins now!
