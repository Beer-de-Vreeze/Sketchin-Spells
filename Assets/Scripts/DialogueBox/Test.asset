  - "Beer stood at the edge of the dense forest, the pale morning sun barely penetrating
    the thick gray fog. A strange sound\u2014a low, resonant hum\u2014echoed through
    the air. It seemed to call out to him, pulling him forward despite the creeping
    sense of unease."
  - "Niels had warned him the night before. \"Don\u2019t go near the forest. People
    don\u2019t come back.\" Beer dismissed it as local superstition, but now, with
    the eerie sound wrapping around him, the warning resurfaced. His curiosity got
    the better of him."
  - 'As Beer ventured deeper, the fog thickened, coiling around the gnarled trees
    like living tendrils. The hum grew louder, morphing into faint whispers. He could
    make out fragments of words: "Closer... Find us..." They were neither threatening
    nor inviting.'
  - "Noah, Joah, and Merijn had planned to meet him at sunrise, but they hadn\u2019t
    shown up. Beer glanced at his phone, hoping for a signal, but the screen remained
    dark. The realization struck him\u2014he hadn\u2019t seen the sun since entering
    the fog."
  - "The ground beneath Beer\u2019s feet grew soft, almost spongy, and the air carried
    a metallic tang. He saw faint lights ahead, flickering in and out of view. Were
    they lanterns? Eyes? His instincts screamed to turn back, but his legs carried
    him forward.\n\n"
  - 'He stumbled into a clearing, where the fog thinned just enough to reveal a ring
    of ancient stones. Each was etched with symbols that seemed to shift and writhe.
    The hum was deafening now, pulsating in time with the glowing stones.


'
  - "\u201CWho are you?\u201D a voice echoed, low and melodic. Beer turned to see
    a figure emerge\u2014a woman with glowing eyes and hair like woven starlight.
    She stood tall, her presence both regal and alien. \u201CWhy have you come to
    the boundary?\u201D"
  - "\u201CI... I heard the sound,\u201D Beer stammered, his courage faltering. The
    woman tilted her head, studying him like a specimen under glass. \u201CFew hear
    the call. Fewer still follow it. You\u2019ve crossed into the Veil, and now you
    must decide.\u201D"
  - "She extended a hand, her fingers shimmering like liquid silver. \u201CStay and
    learn the truths of this world, or leave and forget you ever heard the hum.\u201D
    Beer hesitated, his heart pounding. He thought of his friends waiting for him\u2014if
    they even still were."
  - Beer reached for her hand, the fog swallowing him whole as their fingers touched.
    The hum quieted, replaced by silence. Somewhere beyond the Veil, the forest grew
    still again, waiting for the next curious soul to hear its echo.
